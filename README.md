# u8glib_Animations
Just a place to share some animations for 128x64 lcd screen with u8glib library
 Until now i've created 2 animations: medium invader from Space Invader ( the crabby one ) and Pac-man.
 Those are to be used in combination with the great u8glib  library for 128x64 lcd display for Arduino.
 Link to u8glib library here: https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib
 These animation are part of a bigger project which you can check out on my website: http://napan0sdiy.altervista.org
